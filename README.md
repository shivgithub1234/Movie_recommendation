# Movie Recommendation API

This project is a FastAPI-based backend service for recommending movies based on user input. It offers two recommendation strategies: one using traditional cosine similarity on metadata, and another using a sentence transformer model to find semantically similar movies.

Whether you're building a movie discovery app or experimenting with recommendation systems, this API is designed to be easy to use, flexible, and fast.
